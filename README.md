salieri is a fullscreen, keyboard-first, local-only productivity environment for developers, students, and researchers who need deep focus and minimal context switching. it integrates code editing, journaling, task tracking, and personal accountability into a cohesive workflow, entirely offline. everything you do in this, stays in this. no external windows, no pop-ups, it's all right here.
