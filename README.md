salieri is a fullscreen, keyboard-first, local-only productivity environment for developers, students, and researchers who need deep focus and minimal context switching. it integrates code editing, journaling, task tracking, and personal accountability into a cohesive workflow, entirely offline. everything you do in this, stays in this. no external windows, no pop-ups, it's all within the application. 

take notes, do your homework, program the next big thing. read your lecture notes, catch up on those papers you've been putting off. you don't need adobe, word, and vscode. you just need salieri.
